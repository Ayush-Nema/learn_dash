A repository to learn about [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/introduction) via curated hands-on tutorials.

But what is Dash?
-------------------
![Dash logo](dash_logo.svg "Plotly Dash logo")  
Dash is an open source framework for building data visualization interfaces. Released in 2017 as a Python library, it’s
grown to include implementations for R and Julia. Dash helps data scientists build analytical web applications without
requiring advanced web development knowledge.

Three technologies constitute the core of Dash:

1. **Flask** supplies the web server functionality.
2. **React.js** renders the user interface of the web page.
3. **Plotly.js** generates the charts used in your application.

But you don’t have to worry about making all these technologies work together. Dash will do that for you. You just need
to write Python, R, or Julia and sprinkle it with a bit of CSS.

The repository contains four tutorials:

- _Tutorial_1_: demonstrates a basic web-app for Stock data of certain organisations
- _Tutorial_2_: contains more sophisticated app for Avocado price prediction analytics. It makes use of external CSS
  files to style the app, also it uses Dash `callbacks` to provide interactivity.
- _Tutorial_3_: teaches how to create an app (2 column format) on Stock data using external CSS files (`style.css`),
  also contains `callback` procedures for graph interactions.
- _Tutorial_4_: has a very basic app for demonstrating various widgets that come with Dash.
- _Tutorial_5_: contains various subsections. _demo_1_ demonstrates fundamental features for Dash
  `Datatable` and _demo_2_ onwards has code for more advanced and customised data tables.
